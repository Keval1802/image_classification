# Fire–No Fire Image Classification

## Project Overview

This project implements an **image classification system** to detect whether an image contains **Fire** or **No Fire** using **Computer Vision and Deep Learning**. A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is trained on labeled images to automatically learn visual features such as color patterns, edges, and textures.

The model can be used for **early fire detection**, **surveillance systems**, and **safety monitoring applications**.

## Key Features

* Binary image classification (Fire / No Fire)
* CNN-based deep learning model
* Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
* Trained and evaluated on labeled dataset
* Simple and scalable architecture

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* OpenCV (optional)

---

## How It Works

1. Images are resized and normalized before training.
2. CNN extracts important visual features from images.
3. The model learns patterns associated with fire and non-fire images.
4. Trained model predicts the class of new input images.
